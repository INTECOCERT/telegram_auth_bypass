CONTENTS

* tg-victim/

	This directory contains a modified version of the tg client for Telegram.

	This client uses the "ilegitimate" key, stored in mitm-tg.pub, instead of 
	the legitimate one in tg.pub. 

	In order to compile it and create the binaries, follow the same instructions
	than the legitimate client. Namely, run ./configure; make.

	To run the client, use the command:

		tg-victim/telegram -k tg.pub [-L <logfile> -V]

	When specified the -L flag, a log of the messages sent is stored in
	<logfile>. With -V, a more detailed dump of the messages received and
	sent is printed to stdout.

	Despite specifying the legitimate public key, the ilegitimate one will
	be used.

* tg-mitm-1auth/

	This directory contains the MITM for the PoC, also based in the tg client
	for Telegram.

	In order to compile it and create the binaries, follow the same instructions
	than the legitimate client. Namely, run ./configure; make.

	To run the client, use the command:

		tg-mitm-1auth/telegram -k tg.pub -P <port> [-L <logfile> -V]

	When specified the -L flag, a log of the messages sent is stored in
	<logfile>. With -V, a more detailed dump of the messages received and
	sent is printed to stdout.

	This program opens a socket at the specified local port. It will wait for
	connections to that socket. The client also loads the private key associated
	to the mitm-tg.pub key, loaded by the ilegitimate client.

	The 1auth name comes from the fact that this client is only able to attend
	1 authentication request at a time.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE POC

	Since the MITM program is only able to handle 1 request at a time, and 
	during a protocol run several parallel authentications are executed (at 
	least during the performed test, 5 protocol runs were done), it is
	necessary to launch 5 instances of the MITM program. For instance:

		tg-mitm-1auth/telegram -k tg.pub -P 65521
		tg-mitm-1auth/telegram -k tg.pub -P 65522
		tg-mitm-1auth/telegram -k tg.pub -P 65523
		tg-mitm-1auth/telegram -k tg.pub -P 65524
		tg-mitm-1auth/telegram -k tg.pub -P 65525

	After having launched the 5 MITMs, the victim may be lauched with:

		tg-victim/telegram -k tg.pub

	The client will run exactly as a legitimate one. It will request the
	cell phone number to which the SMS code will be sent, and will
	subsequently wait for that code to be introduced. After sending back
	the code, the program exits.

	If you have your Telegram account already set up in another device, a
	notification will be received in that device, confirming the success
	of the authentication.

IMPORTANT NOTE

	Each time the PoC is run, several hidden folders are created in your 
	home directory: .telegram-mitm-client, .telegram-mitm-server1,	
	.telegram-mitm-server2, ..., .telegram-mitm-server5. To reproduce the
	process, this folders need to be removed.

	This PoC has been tested in a Debian "Jessie" machine.
